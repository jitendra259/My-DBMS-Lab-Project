# College Database – DBMS Lab

This project was completed as part of the DBMS laboratory to understand database design and implementation using SQL.

## Lab 1: SQL DDL and DML Operations

* Created a database named **CollegeDB**.
* Created tables such as Student and Course using CREATE TABLE.
* Modified table structure using ALTER TABLE (added and renamed columns).
* Inserted records into the tables.
* Performed SELECT queries to retrieve data.
* Updated and deleted records to understand data manipulation.

## Lab 2: ER Diagram Design

* Identified entities like Student, Department, Course, etc.
* Defined attributes for each entity.
* Established relationships between entities.
* Drew the ER diagram to represent the college database structure.

## Lab 3: Relational Schema Implementation

* Converted the ER diagram into relational tables.
* Applied Primary Keys and Foreign Keys.
* Implemented the schema using SQL commands.
* Ensured proper relationships and data integrity.

-## Tools Used

* SQL / SQL*Plus
* draw.io (for ER Diagram)

This lab helped in understanding how a real-world database system is designed and implemented.
